# PlantsIdentifier

I recently adopted a cat and found out there are some plants that are dangerous for him! So i've set out to build a mobile App which leverages Azure Custom Vision. 

It is a Xamarin.Forms App, with a .NET Core support Backend (yes, I use a Mac with VSCode :) ). 
All connections from the App pass through the backend to be able to monitor it a bit better.
